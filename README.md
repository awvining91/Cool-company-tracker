## Micro-manage your team with ease! :(

Channel your inner Jeff Bezos and micro manage your teams. Just kidding, this app just shows different team member's 
names, ids, roles and salaries. 

## Challenges

I had all sorts of problems with this challenge, it's hard to know where to start. First the CLI was none responsive and I couldn't figure out why, and then inquirer of all things was starting to give me problems as well. Sometimes it's hard for me to trouble-shoot backend things since it's hard to visualize and to get a feel on what's going wrong.

## Next Steps

Next we are studying object relational mapping which is kind of crazy. We flew through SQL and I kind of understood what was happening but know we are taking it a step furthur with ORM. Converting relational tables to javascript objects with sequelize is the next step.
